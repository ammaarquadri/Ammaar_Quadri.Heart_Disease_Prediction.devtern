## Task 3: Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression

Heart disease is a significant cause of mortality worldwide, emphasizing the importance of early detection and risk prediction for improving patient outcomes. This repository guides you through using logistic regression to predict the risk of heart disease in patients. We leverage the Framingham Heart Study dataset, which contains crucial information on cardiovascular risk factors.

### Task Overview

**Objective:** Build a logistic regression model to predict the risk of heart disease in patients.

### Dataset

You can access the Framingham Heart Study dataset [here](link_to_dataset).

### Task Execution

1. **Data Preparation**
   - **Data Cleaning:** Address missing values, outliers, and duplicates in the dataset. Manage missing data by removing rows or using techniques like mean, median, or predictive modeling.
   - **Data Splitting:** Divide the dataset into training and test sets. Typically, use a split ratio like 70-30 or 80-20 for training and evaluation.

2. **Building the Logistic Regression Model**
   - Construct a logistic regression model tailored for predicting the risk of heart disease. Logistic regression models the probability of the presence of heart disease based on input features.

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate the performance of the logistic regression model on the test set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into how well the model predicts the risk of heart disease.

4. **Analyzing Model Coefficients**
   - Logistic regression models provide coefficients for each feature, indicating their impact on predicting the likelihood of heart disease. Positive coefficients suggest increased risk, while negative coefficients suggest decreased risk. Analyzing these coefficients helps understand the factors contributing to heart disease risk.

This project offers a comprehensive guide to leveraging logistic regression for predicting heart disease risk using real-world data, aiming to enhance early detection and patient care strategies.
